![x86 Assembly Language and Shellcoding on Linux]({{"/content/posts/slae.png" | absolute_url }}){: .center}

This blog post has been created for completing the requirements of the [SecurityTube Linux Assembly Expert certification](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3).

# Goal

The goal of this assignment is to create a custom crypter for a shellcode in any language.

# Methods

I used Python 3 and the [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) encryption method. To execute the [shellcode](http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-575.php) I relied on [hacktracking](http://hacktracking.blogspot.com/2015/05/execute-shellcode-in-python.html)'s awesome guide on executing shellcode in Python.

# Code

The code is very simple, I'm only using 3 functions:

* exec(payload)
* encrypt(plaintext)
* decrypt(ciphertext)

The first function does the execution, it loads the payload into the memory and executes it. 

The second and third function takes care of the encryption/decryption of the payload. I used Fernet because the algorithm only requires the key and takes care of everything else for you.

Other than these three functions, only the basic I/O handling is implemented.

Usage:

    python ./crypter.py <encrypt/decrypt> <payload/encrypted payload>

When an encrypted payload is fed in, the script decrypts the payload and tries to execute it, otherwise the plaintext payload is encrypted and printed to the stdout.

# Final Thoughts

Python is awesome, Fernet is easy to use. A+++.

Again, all the code is on my [Github](https://github.com/fuzboxz/SLAE) and if you want to be informed about new posts, just follow me on Twitter at [@fuzboxz](https://twitter.com/fuzboxz).
