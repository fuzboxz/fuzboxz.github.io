From an *infosec* perspective, this year was the bee's knees. I managed to attend [OWASP AppSec California](https://2018.appseccalifornia.org/), SBCTF, [LayerOne](https://www.layerone.org/) and [ShellCon](https://shellcon.io/), but sadly I missed [DEFCON](https://defcon.org/). The best training that I took this year was also the cheapest, [Aaron Guzman's (@scriptingxss))](https://twitter.com/scriptingxss) IoT Firmware Exploitation and Reverse Engineering Training thought me a lot about IoT security. I earned three more certifications: *[eCPPT](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ecppt/)*, *[CCSK v4](https://ccsk.cloudsecurityalliance.org/en)* and *[OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/)*. I also had *[SLAE](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3)* planned for this year, but the last two assignments are unfortunately not too exciting, so I'm still dragging my feet there. The highlight of the year was a whole week of threat modeling on a "new" product, which gave me the opportunity to meet smart people and ask questions about their craft. I also achieved first place on the SBCTF '18 with the *clusterduck* team. My only regret is that I spent too little time on IoT/hardware hacking, but at least I managed to set up my lab. 

Music-wise, I started the year with a *[Digitakt](https://www.elektron.se/products/digitakt/)*, but after the vaporware Overbridge support I sold it and promised myself not to buy Elektron products for a while. I switched to *[Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/)* from *[Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/)* because *Linux*. I still hate their subscription based pricing model, but the DAW matured a lot and the new modulators are game changing. I also started using *[u-he Zebra2, Hive and BazilleCM](https://u-he.com/)* instead of *NI Massive and other Komplete synths*. I'm still using *[Reaktor](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/reaktor-6/)* though, there are some really exotic ensambles that would cost an arm and leg if they came in a plugin form. Unfortunately, I didn't spend enough time on making music, but I wrote a [new song for a compilation](https://lostgems.bandcamp.com/track/crust), so that's nice. The distortion is really fuzzy.

Next year, I plan to do more appsec, more travelling, more music and MORE EVERYTHING.
