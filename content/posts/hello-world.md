I have not written anything publicly in almost seven years. At the time, I was living in California and spending most of my energy on IoT, hardware hacking, and offensive security. Since then, a lot has changed. I moved back to Europe, completed two degrees, and worked on dozens of interesting products across a wide range of technology stacks.

Over the past year, I have also found myself returning to small, exploratory projects—the kind driven more by curiosity than by roadmaps or deadlines. That has been the catalyst for restarting this blog. My goal is to share insights from those personal experiments, reflect on professional experiences, and occasionally explore the space in between.

Lately, much of my work—both professional and personal—has been adjacent to AI. Agentic IDEs, in particular, pulled me back into hands-on coding. They allow me to move faster, test ideas more freely, and recover from dead ends that would previously have stalled projects entirely. From that perspective, generative AI has been a genuine accelerant.

At the same time, the current hype cycle has brought its share of problems: bots and propaganda, increasingly convincing deepfakes, vast resources sunk into dead-end projects, infrastructure strain, and a wave of AI evangelism from executives convinced that everyone and everything is replaceable.

Still, I am optimistic. Once the noise subsides, I believe the technology will settle into something more useful and more human. If we are intentional about it, we—the people actually building and using these systems—can shape them to work for us rather than the other way around.
