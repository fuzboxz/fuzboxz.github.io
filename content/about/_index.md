This is the professionally personal blog of **Jozsef Ottucsak** (*@fuzboxz*).

You can read about my pet projects, experiments, or thoughts about topics from areas of tech including *enterprise **software engineering*** (especially ***product security***), *artificial intelligence/machine learning, neurodiversity in tech, audio/visual technology, rapid prototyping, generative arts*, or anything else that I might think about.

Professionally, I have 12+ years of experience working in technology focusing mostly on product/software security. I have worked as a software engineer, penetration tester, application security engineer and I'm currently working as a **product security architect**. 

As a hobby, I like fiddling with creative technology including music production, generative arts, A/V tech, and rapid prototyping. I also make audio/visual art under the pseudonym [Cursor to XYZ](https://www.youtube.com/@cursortoxyz).
